# Homebrew cask for dreamd. The source of truth lives HERE, in the dreamd repo;
# bongofongo/homebrew-tap/Casks/dreamd.rb is generated from it by the `tap` job
# in .github/workflows/release.yml, which substitutes the three tokens below.
#
# Keep this file in the shape `brew style` wants. The tap job runs
# `brew style --fix` before committing, so any deviation is silently rewritten
# there and the generated cask stops matching this template.
#
#   brew install --cask bongofongo/tap/dreamd

  # Mapping the architecture to the full Rust target triple means exactly one
  # `url` line — only the checksum genuinely differs per arch, which is what
  # keeps the CI bump a three-token substitution.
